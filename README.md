### Hi there 👋


My name is Dennis Alves, I'm a frontend developer from Brazil currently working at [@cryptocurrencytrader](https://github.com/cryptocurrencytrader) (a.k.a. [Bitcointrade](https://broker.bitcointrade.com.br) ).

My main tech stack 🔋 currently is ReactJS with Typescript.

I'm currently 📚 learning software testing.

And right now I'm working 🛠 on a open source [Date Range Selector component](https://github.com/dennis90/react-range-dates)
