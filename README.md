My name is Dennis Alves, I'm a frontend developer from Brazil currently working at (@cryptocurrencytrader)[https://github.com/cryptocurrencytrader] (a.k.a. [Bitcointrade](https://broker.bitcointrade.com.br) ).

My main tech stack currently is ReactJS with Typescript.

I'm currently learning software testing.

And right now I'm working on a open source [Date Range Selector component](https://github.com/dennis90/react-range-dates)
